Theme: Two button controls and growing.

Tools
SourceTree
Unity 5.3.0f4

Open project
Select folder "<GIT_WORKING_FOLDER>\LUDUMDARE34\unityproject\LD34"
Press Open
**I had an issue where I had to open a sample project, and then open the project from the file menu

Ideas:
1. Literal binary tree.
	Pull Water resource from the root, and traverse the tree with Left / Right buttons to a leaf.
	Once at a leaf, the Water is spent and the leaf gains one or two children.
	If leaves are not watered, they start to wither. If a leaf if watered too much, it will terminate permanently in a Fruit instead of gaining children.
	The more Fruit, the more you win.
