Theme: Two button controls and growing.

Ideas:
Literal binary tree. Pull Water resource from the root, and traverse the tree with Left / Right buttons to a leaf. Once at a leaf, the Water is spent and the leaf gains one or two children. If leaves are not watered, they start to wither. If a leaf if watered too much, it will terminate permanently in a Fruit instead of gaining children. The more Fruit, the more you win.
